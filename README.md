# Fruit-Recognition-Color-Extraction

Fruit Recognition using Deep Learning.
Image Feature Extraction using PreTrained Models, Keras library also provides the pretrained models(VGG16, InceptionNet,Resnet, XceptionNet, etc) in which one can load the saved model weights, and use them for different purposes : transfer learning, image feature extraction, and object detection.
After feature extraction process simple neural network (multi layer perceptron) used for training and predictions.
